      Quick reminder that our last meetup of 2025 is on Thursday, and we still
      have a few tickets available! We have two fantastic speakers lined up to
      share some wisdom, a special giveaway of the "Principles of Building AI
      Agents" book by Sam Bhagwat, delicious Neapolitan pizza freshly baked by
      our friends from Pala Restaurant, drinks and snacks, and most importantly,
      a fantastic community of fellow geeks waiting for you to join us. We're
      looking forward to seeing you there!
